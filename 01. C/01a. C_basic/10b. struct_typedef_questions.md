# <p align="center">**Structure - Questions**</p>

### Question 1: 

```C
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    struct Point p1 = {10, 20};
    // Accessing members of the struct
    // ...
}
```

Which of the following correctly accesses the x member of the p1 struct?
1. p1.x
2. p1->x
3. x.p1
4. x->p1

### Question 2: 

```C
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int roll_no;
    float marks;
};
```

What is the correct way to declare a variable of the Student struct named s1?

1. struct Student s1;
2. Student s1;
3. struct s1;
4. s1 Student;

### Question 3: 

- What is the output of the following code?
```C
struct Employee {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
};

int main() {
    struct Employee emp;
    strcpy(emp.name, "John Doe");
    emp.age = 30;
    emp.salary = 5000.0;
    printf("%s is %d years old and earns %.2f\n", 
            emp.name, emp.age, emp.salary);
}
```

### Question 4:

```C
struct Book {
  char title[50];
  char author[50];
  int year;
};

int main() {
  struct Book b1 = {"The Lord of the Rings", "J.R.R. Tolkien", 1954};
  // ...
}
```

How do you access the author member of the b1 struct?
1. b1.author
2. b1->author
3. author.b1
4. author->b1

### Question 5:
- What is the output of the following program?
```C
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
  struct Point p1 = {10, 20};
  struct Point p2 = p1;
  printf("p2.x = %d, p2.y = %d", p2.x, p2.y);
}
```
### Question 6:
```C
struct Rectangle {
  int width;
  int height;
};

int main() {
  struct Rectangle rect;
  // ...
}
```
Which of the following is the correct way to assign the value 5 to the width member of the rect struct?
1. width = 5;
2. rect.width = 5;
3. Rectangle.width = 5;
4. rect->width = 5;

### Question 7:
```C
struct Circle {
  float radius;
};

float calculateArea(struct Circle c) {
  // ...
}

int main () {
    struct Circle c1;
    // call calculateArea
    return 0;
}
```
How do you pass the c1 struct to the calculateArea function?
1. calculateArea(c1.radius);
2. calculateArea(&c1);
3. calculateArea(c1);
4. calculateArea(Circle);

### Question 8:
```C
struct Person {
  char name[50];
  int age;
};

int main() {
  struct Person *ptr;
  struct Person p1 = {"Jane Doe", 25};
  ptr = &p1;
  // ...

  return 0;
}
```
How do you access the age member of the p1 struct using the ptr pointer?

1. ptr.age
2. ptr->age
3. age.ptr
4. age->ptr

### Question 9:
```C
typedef struct {
  int x;
  int y;
} Point;

int main() {
  Point p1 = {10, 20};
  // ...
}
```
What is the purpose of the typedef keyword in this code?
1. To define a new data type called Point.
2. To create an alias Point for the struct definition.
3. To declare a variable of the struct named Point.
4. To dynamically allocate memory for the struct.

### Question 10:
```C
struct Product {
  char name[50];
  float price;
};

int main() {
  struct Product prod;
  struct Product *ptr;
  ptr = &prod; 
  // ...
}
```
Which of the following correctly assigns the value "Laptop" to the name member of the prod struct using the ptr pointer?
1. ptr.name = "Laptop";
2. *ptr.name = "Laptop";
3. strcpy(ptr->name, "Laptop");
4. strcpy(ptr.name, "Laptop");
