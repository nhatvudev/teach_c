    cout << "\ny = " << y;
    return 0;
}
```

### Question 9:

```CPP
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
int main() {
    int a = 0b00000001;
    int b = 0b1;
    int c = 1;
    if (a == b && b == c)
        cout << "a = b = c";
    else
       cout << "!";

int main() {
    int a = 0b00011001;
    int bit0 = a & 0b1;
    int bit1 = (a >> 1) & 0b1;
    int bit2 = (a >> 2) & 0b1;
    int bit3 = (a >> 3) & 0b1;
    int bit4 = (a >> 4) & 0b1;
    cout << "a = " << a;
    cout << "\nbit 0 = " << bit0;
    cout << "\nbit 1 = " << bit1;
    cout << "\nbit 2 = " << bit2;
    cout << "\nbit 3 = " << bit3;
    cout << "\nbit 4 = " << bit4;

```
a = 25
bit 0 = 1
bit 1 = 0
bit 2 = 0
bit 3 = 1
bit 4 = 1

### Question 11:
- Explain output of the following program:
```CPP
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    int a = 0b1;
    int b = (0b1 << 2) | a;
    cout << "a = " << a;
    cout << "\nb = " << b;
    return 0;
}
```
- Output:
```
a = 1
b = 5
```

### Question 12:
- Why is b equal to b in the following program?
```CPP
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
int main() {
    int a = 6;
    int b = (0b1 << 2) | a;
    cout << "a = " << a;
    cout << "\nb = " << b;
    return 0;
}
```
- Output:
```
a = 6
b = 6
```

### Question 13:
- What is the output of the following program?
```CPP
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
int main() {
    int a = 6;
    int b = (0b1 << 3) | a;
    cout << "a = " << a;
    cout << "\nb = " << b;
    return 0;
}
```

### Question 14:
- Explain output of the following program
```CPP
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    int a = 7;
    int b = ~(0b1 << 2) & a;
    cout << "a = " << a;
    cout << "\nb = " << b;
    return 0;
}
```

- Output:
```
a = 7
b = 3
```

### Question 15:
- Why is b equal to a in the following program?
```CPP
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
int main() {
    int a = 8;
    int b = ~(0b1 << 2) & a;
    cout << "a = " << a;
    cout << "\nb = " << b;
    return 0;
